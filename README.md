# Prims-Visualization

The purpose of this project is to create a visualization that will represent how Primâ€™s MST algorithm works. It will not only show a visualization, but also allow for customizable features within the graph to allow users to better understand how this algorithm works. This visualization will be accessible on p5.js and use javascript for running the calculations. 

The library being utilized is a javascript library called p5.js, to help represent the graph. When the visualizations are initially run, a randomly generated graph will be displayed.
